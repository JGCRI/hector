title: Adding a new variable
---

Adding a new variable to a method
using getData to obtain the information defined in the ini file

In hector.ini under the corresponding component add variable
	Ex: SN = 42000;


In hpp file of component add variable as tseries/unitval/double/etc. 

In component_data.hpp define the variables that are being added
	Ex: #define D_ATMOSPHERIC_SO2 "SN"
	These names do *not* have to match internal component variables but 
	the ini definition *has to* match what appears in quotes

In the component file .cpp 
	under init, need to register the Capability
	core->registerCapability( D_ATMOSPHERIC_SO2, getComponentName() );

In cpp file of component, under getData and setData, add the new variables in before the Error message 
NOTE: see tseries documentation for more information on getData

	(getData)
	else if( varName == D_ATMOSPHERIC_SO2 ) {
       
	returnval = SN;
        
	(setData)
	else if( varName ==  D_ATMOSPHERIC_SO2  ) {
           
	H_ASSERT( data.date == Core::undefinedIndex(), "date not allowed" );
   
        SN.set( lexical_cast<double>( value ), U_GG );
        }


If this variable is called in another component.
	For example if adding in a variable within the focing component
        Ex: unitval SN = core->getData( D_ATMOSPHERIC_SO2, runToDate);

If this variable is a unitval, the new unitval needs to appear in the unitval.hpp file.
