title: Constraints
---

The Hector model can be run subject to *constraints* that force the model to have certain behavior. Technically, this means that the model's components output user-provided data as opposed to their own calculations, similar to the [data mode](http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm1.0/cesm/cesm_doc_1_0_4/x42.html) of a CESM sub-model. Currently the available constraints include:

**Temperature**. If the current [input file](InputFiles.html) includes, in its `[temperature]` section, a line of form

```
tgav_constrain=csv:path/to/constraint/file.csv
```

then the model's global mean temperature `Tgav` will follow this contents of this file (which should have two columns, `Date` and `tgav_constrain`; a sample file is included in the repository). The model will extrapolate within this data as necessary, but not beyond its endpoints.

Once Hector's internal date passes the last date in the constraint file, the model's temperature component becomes *unconstrained*, except that we do not permit it to suddenly jump to a new temperature. Instead, changes in global radiative forcing (from which temperature change is computed) are applied to the end-of-constraint temperature. For more details, see the detailed comments in the `TemperatureComponent::run` method.

**Radiative forcing**. If the current [input file](InputFiles.html) includes, in its `[forcing]` section, a line of form

```
Ftot_constrain=csv:path/to/constraint/file.csv
```

then the model's global radiative forcing `Ftot`, that drives global temperature changes, will follow this contents of this file (which should have two columns, `Date` and `Ftot_constrain`). The model will extrapolate within this data as necessary, but not beyond its endpoints. Once Hector's internal date passes the last date in the constraint file, the model's forcing component becomes *unconstrained*.

**Ocean C uptake**. If the current [input file](InputFiles.html) includes, in its `[ocean]` section, a line of form

```
oceanflux_constrain=csv:path/to/constraint/file.csv
```

then the model's ocean carbon uptake (in Pg C) will follow this contents of this file (which should have two columns, `Date` and `oceanflux_constrain`). The model will extrapolate within this data as necessary, but not beyond its endpoints. Once Hector's internal date passes the last date in the constraint file, the model's ocean uptake becomes *unconstrained*.

**Atmospheric CO2**. If the current [input file](InputFiles) includes, in its `[simpleNbox]` section, a line of form

```
CO2_constrain=csv:path/to/constraint/file.csv
```

then the model's atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2], given in ppmv CO2) will follow the contents of this file (which should have two columns, `Date` and `CO2_constrain`).
Alternatively, Hector's atmospheric CO2 concentration constraint can be set using the `setvars` function and `CO2_CONSTRAIN` variable.

The CO2 constraint is applied at the _end_ of the current time step.
The full sequence of events is as follows:
First, the model solves the current time-step's carbon cycle conditioned on the previous time step's carbon pools, ignoring the CO2 constraint.
Then, if a CO2 constraint is present, Hector calculates the difference between its calculated atmospheric CO2 and the prescribed CO2 constraint.
If the target atmospheric CO2 concentration is lower than the calculated CO2, the excess carbon is transferred from the atmosphere to the deep ocean;
conversely, if the target atmospheric CO2 concentration is greater than the calculated value, the additional carbon is transferred from the deep ocean into the atmosphere.
Finally, Hector records the current atmospheric CO2 concentration (which is now equal to the constraint value); this is the value that is used in the next time step's evaluation of carbon-climate feedbacks (e.g. CO2 fertilization of net primary productivity, surface ocean carbonate chemistry).
In other words, an atmospheric CO2 constraint at time $t$ does not affect carbon-climate feedbacks until $t+1$.

The CO2 constraint need not span the entirety of the Hector simulation, or even be continuous.
At any given time step, Hector will check whether or not a CO2 constraint exists at that time step and only apply the constraint if it is present.
This means that "hybrid" runs are possible, where only some specific time ranges have CO2 constraints while others calculate the atmospheric carbon pool and CO2 concentrations according to Hector's standard [carbon cycle](SimpleNBox).
Note that Hector _does not perform any interpolation of constraints_ -- they are applied only in the exact years that they are provided by the user, and all other years are treated (including those immediately before or after constrained years) are treated as unconstrained.
This means that constraints can abruptly force Hector's climate system into state that is inconsistent with the previous time step.
Concentrations for the first year of a constraint can be discontinuous compared to the previous year without a constraint.
Concentrations after the last year of a constraint will not necessarily have a discontinuity, but the behavior of the carbon cycle may change after this point.
It is the user's responsibility to make sure that constraints are continuous.
