title: Constraints
---

The Hector model can be run subject to *constraints* that force the model to have certain behavior. Technically, this means that the model's components output user-provided data as opposed to their own calculations, similar to the [data mode](http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm1.0/cesm/cesm_doc_1_0_4/x42.html) of a CESM sub-model. Currently the available constraints include:

**Temperature**. If the current [input file](InputFiles.html) includes, in its `[temperature]` section, a line of form

```
tgav_constrain=csv:path/to/constraint/file.csv
```

then the model's global mean temperature `Tgav` will follow this contents of this file (which should have two columns, `Date` and `tgav_constrain`; a sample file is included in the repository). The model will extrapolate within this data as necessary, but not beyond its endpoints.

Once Hector's internal date passes the last date in the constraint file, the model's temperature component becomes *unconstrained*, except that we do not permit it to suddenly jump to a new temperature. Instead, changes in global radiative forcing (from which temperature change is computed) are applied to the end-of-constraint temperature. For more details, see the detailed comments in the `TemperatureComponent::run` method.

**Radiative forcing**. If the current [input file](InputFiles.html) includes, in its `[forcing]` section, a line of form

```
Ftot_constrain=csv:path/to/constraint/file.csv
```

then the model's global radiative forcing `Ftot`, that drives global temperature changes, will follow this contents of this file (which should have two columns, `Date` and `Ftot_constrain`). The model will extrapolate within this data as necessary, but not beyond its endpoints. Once Hector's internal date passes the last date in the constraint file, the model's forcing component becomes *unconstrained*.

**Ocean C uptake**. If the current [input file](InputFiles.html) includes, in its `[ocean]` section, a line of form

```
oceanflux_constrain=csv:path/to/constraint/file.csv
```

then the model's ocean carbon uptake (in Pg C) will follow this contents of this file (which should have two columns, `Date` and `oceanflux_constrain`). The model will extrapolate within this data as necessary, but not beyond its endpoints. Once Hector's internal date passes the last date in the constraint file, the model's ocean uptake becomes *unconstrained*.

**Atmospheric CO2**. If the current [input file](InputFiles) includes, in its `[simpleNbox]` section, a line of form

```
Ca_constrain=csv:path/to/constraint/file.csv
```

then the model's atmospheric carbon pool (given in ppmv CO2) will follow this contents of this file (which should have two columns, `Date` and `Ca_constrain`). The model will extrapolate within this data as necessary, but not beyond its endpoints. If the constraint [CO2] is lower than the calculated [CO2] at that time step, any excess is moved to the deep ocean; conversely, any necessary deficit is transferred from there.

Once Hector's internal date passes the last date in the constraint file, the model's atmospheric CO2 becomes *unconstrained*.
