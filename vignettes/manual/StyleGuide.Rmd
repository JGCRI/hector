title: Style guide

Hector coding style:
-----------------------
- basic file into at top of every file (see existing examples)
- spaces within parentheses and around math operators
- open curly brace on same line for if, etc.; close on a line by itself
- limit over-length (~75) lines
- line of dashes separating functions
- use 'const' when possible: on functions, parameters, variables
- methods should start with assertions on inputs
- try to use C++ STL or Boost data structures and functions
    (instead of rolling your own)

Hector unit testing:
-----------------------
- writing test case is part of writing code
- every method should have at least one test if possible
- every class/subunit should have a dedicated test group

Hector documentation:
-----------------------
- every method should have Doxygen comment header. Required tags:
    + `\brief`          (always)
    + `\param[in]`      (if any)
    + `\param[out]`     (if any)
    + `\returns`        (if returns a value)
    + `\exception`      (if any throws or assertions)
- all but most trivial vars should have Doxygen comments in headers
- comments should generally say WHY not WHAT
