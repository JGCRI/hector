# Installing and building - R package

The easiest way to install and use Hector is as an R package.
To install R, follow the [official instructions](https://cloud.r-project.org/) for your platform.

To install the version associated with the current `master` git branch on GitHub, use the `devtools::install_github` function.
This will automatically install all of Hector's dependencies as well.
(Note that because this requires compiling from source, you will need to have a C compiler installed and configured.
On **Windows**, you will also need to install [Rtools](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
On **MacOS** and **Linux**, the required tools should be included as part of a standard R installation.)

```r
# If the `devtools` isn't installed, first run:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jgcri/hector")

# You can also install from specific git tags...
devtools::install_github("jgcri/hector@2.2.2")
# ...branches...
devtools::install_github("jgcri/hector@krd-perscribe_co2Con")
# ...or commit hashes.
devtools::install_github("jgcri/hector@16c480a")
```

Finally, to install from a local copy of the source code, you can use the following code:

```r
devtools::install("/path/to/hector")
# For the current directory, use `"."` or run the function with no arguments.
```

...or, if you are using the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), use the "Install and Restart", "Clean and Rebuild", and similar tools in the "Build" tab.

Although very common and broadly useful, the `devtools` package has many R package dependencies, including some with system dependencies.
If you do not want to install `devtools`, you can also install from a local copy by using the base-R `install.packages` function as follows:

```r
install.packages("/path/to/hector", repos = NULL)
```

...or by running the following shell command:

```sh
R CMD INSTALL /path/to/hector
```

However, note that neither of these commands will automatically install Hector's dependencies, so you will have to install them manually.
Hector's mandatory dependencies are listed in the `DESCRIPTION` file under `Imports`, and are currently as follows:

- [`Rcpp`](http://www.rcpp.org/) -- Facilitates integration of C++ code into R packages
- [`BH`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BH/index.html) -- Boost C++ header files


# Installing and building - standalone executable

Hector can also be compiled as a standalone executable.
Unlike the R package, this method of installation does not automatically pull in dependencies, so you will have to install them manually.
Fortunately, Hector's only external dependency--Boost--is freely available under a GPL license.

**Boost** is a free, peer-reviewed portable C++ source library, available at http://www.boost.org/.
Hector primarily uses Boost "header-only" libraries, which do not need to be compiled independently and only need to be extracted and included with the Hector source.
However, Hector currently _does_ depend on two Boost libraries--`system` and `filesystem`--that require compilation.

## Mac OSX (Xcode)

These directions assume a basic familiarity with Xcode and Mac OS X software installation.
If you're going to use `make` and not Xcode, see Linux directions below.

* Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) if necessary. Hector has been built and tested with Mac OS 10.8.5 ~~and 10.10 (Yosemite)~~. The project files are for Xcode 5.1.1.
* Download and install Boost, following instructions above.
* Download the [Hector zip file](https://github.com/JGCRI/hector/archive/master.zip) or check out the repository using Git.
* From Xcode, open the project file in `project_files/Xcode/hector.cxodeproj`.
* Build the project. See below if you encounter errors.
* Change the current Scheme settings (Scheme->Edit Scheme) and add a command-line argument (*Arguments* tab, e.g. "input/hector_rcp45.ini").
* Run!

Xcode Build Settings to check/change if you encounter build errors:

* *Architectures-Base SDK*: OS X 10.8 [or OS X version on machine] 
* *Build Options-Compiler for C/C++/Objective-C*: Default compiler (Apple LLVM 5.1)
* *Search Paths-Header Search Paths*: "/usr/local/include /usr/local/lib/boost_1_52_0/" [or other header directories]
* *Search Paths-Library Search Paths*: "/usr/local/lib/" [or other library directories]
* *LLVM-Language-C++-C++ Standard Library*: libc++ (LLVM C++ standard library with C++11 support)
* *Linking-Other Linker Flags*: "-lgsl -lgslcblas -lm"
* *User-Defined*: "GCC_MODEL_TUNING" defined as "G5"


## Windows

* Install Visual Studio, if necessary.
* Download and install *Boost*, following instructions above.
* Download the [Hector zip file](https://github.com/JGCRI/hector/archive/master.zip) or check out the repository using Git.
* TODO


## Linux

The Hector makefiles look for Boost libraries and headers in certain default
locations, but those defaults can be overridden by setting the
following environment variables:

* `BOOSTROOT` (default `$(HOME)/src/boost_$(BOOSTVERSION)`).
This variable should contain the full name of the directory created
when you unpacked Boost. If you unpacked Boost in `$(HOME)/src`, then
all you need to do is set the `BOOSTVERSION` variable (*q.v.* below) and leave this variable
at its default value. If you unpacked Boost somewhere else, or if you changed the name
of the directory that was created when you unpacked it, then you will
need to set this variable explicitly. 

* `BOOSTVERSION` (default: `1_52_0`). This variable should contain the
version number of the version of Boost that you installed.  The
version number will appear in the name of the tar file you
downloaded. The `BOOSTVERSION` variable is used in the default value of `BOOSTROOT` to determine the default installation
directory. If you override the default value of `BOOSTROOT` you can ignore this variable.

**Shared Library Search Path**

Compiled Boost libraries used by Hector will be
compiled into shared libraries that must be loaded at run time. It is
best if these libraries are in directories that are part of your
system's shared library search path. On many systems `/usr/local` is
already in that path. If you install the libraries somewhere else,
you may need to add the installation directories to the list given in
`/etc/ld.so.conf`. Whether or not you install the GSL libraries in the default location, when you compile and install them 
you may need to refresh the library cache by running
`ldconfig` (which generally requires root privilege), or by rebooting your system 
(which does not).

If you are unable to add your library installation directory to the
library search path, you will need to add the installation directory
to the environment variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.  Try not to use this approach if you 
can help it because it can cause some conflicts with other software on your system.
Instead, ask your system administrator if `ldconfig` is right for you.

**Building Hector**

Once the necessary libraries are installed, change to the top-level
Hector directory and type `make hector`. The hector executable will
be built in the `source/` subdirectory. If you ever need to rebuild,
you can type `make clean` to clear away the executable and all of the
intermediate files.

There are two additional environment variables that you can use to
fine-tune the build process. The `CXXEXTRA` variable is passed to the
C++ compiler. You can use this variable to pass extra options to the
compiler without changing the Makefile. In particular, specifying
optimization options in `CXXEXTRA` such as -O or -O0 will override the
default value of -O3.

The `CXXPROF` variable is passed both to the compiler and the linker.
It is intended to turn on performance profiling, which must be
specified at both the compile and link stages of the build, so it
generally should be either unset (for normal operation) or set to -pg
(for profiling). Profiling slows the code down dramatically, so if you use it, be
sure to unset `CXXPROF`, clean the build directories with `make clean`, 
and rebuild when you are ready to go back to
production runs.
