title: Unit values (`unitvals`)
---

Hector both *allows* (internally to each component, and when reading inputs) and *requires* (passing data between components, and writing outputs) values to have associated **units**. The internal unit system is simple, not providing [unit conversion](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_57_0/doc/html/boost_units.html) for example, but also lightweight and easy. Our use of units is prompted primarily by safety–to avoid the "Mars Climate Orbiter" [problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter#Cause_of_failure) of mismatched unit–as well as having easy-to-interpret outputs.

The internal C++ type is called `unitval`, and its code is located in `headers/data/unitval.hpp`.

Creating a variable with associated unit
--------------

Two ways to create a `unitval`:
```
unitval x(1, U_PGC);  # x now holds 1 petagram of carbon
unitval y;
y.set(2, U_CO2_PPMV);
```

Doing math
--------------

The `unitval` class supports basic mathematical operations.
```
# assume that y and z are already defined unitvals
unitval x = y + z;  # y and z must have identical units or an error is thrown
unitval x = y * 2.0;  # multiplying by a constant always works
```

Extracting a `unitval` value
--------------
Internally within components, we often simply want to work with numbers, extracting them from `unitval` objects. This is straightforward, but first we have to 'prove' that we know the correct units:

```
double x = y.value(U_PGC); # we assert that y's units are petagrams C
```

When is `unitval` required?
--------------
Using `unitvals` *within* a component is optional, but it's required when passing data *between* components. This falls into three categories:

* Querying the core for data. Read more about Hector's internal [data passing](InternalDataPassing.html).
* Responding to a query for data.
* Output. Read more about Hector's [output visitors](OutputVisitors.html).

When is `unitval` optional?
--------------
In input files.

TODO.

```
if( varName == D_PREINDUSTRIAL_N2O ) {`
            `H_ASSERT( data.date == Core::undefinedIndex() , "date not allowed" );`
            `N0 = unitval::parse_unitval( data.value_str, data.units_str, U_PPBV_N2O );`
```
