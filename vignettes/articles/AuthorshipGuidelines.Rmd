title: "Authorship Guidelines"
---

As mentioned in our [contribution guide](ContributionsGuide.html), “the Hector
team welcomes and values community contributions to Hector” and would like to
acknowledge these contributions. To be fully transparent, here are the guidelines
we use to determine authorship for the Hector model.

* The author list reflects individuals that contributed code (either R code in
support of the R Hector package and/or C++ Hector source code) to a specific
version of Hector.
* The author list is not a running list of all Hector contributors over the
years. In general, individuals on the author list have made major code
contributions to either the current or the immediately previous version of the model.
* We recognize contributors to older versions of the model via the table of past
contributors (see below). This author list does not include contributors to other
Hector-related software such as HectorUI or Hectordata. The list also does not
credit authorship for generating model development ideas, analysis, and so on.
This category of credit occurs in manuscripts focused on model documentation or
analyses using Hector.
