## Hector Publications {#hector_documentation}

There are three documentation manuscripts for Hector. 

### Hector v1 
> Hartin, C. A., Patel, P., Schwarber, A., Link, R. P., and Bond-Lamberty, B. P. (2015). A simple object-oriented and open-source model for scientific and policy analyses of the global climate system – Hector v1.0, Geosci. Model Dev., 8, 939–955. https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-8-939-2015.

The original manuscript for Hector v1.0 was published in 2015. Hector is an open-source, object-oriented simple global carbon cycle model. The model takes in  CO$_2$ and non-CO$_2$ emissions (e.g., CH$_4$, N$_2$O), converting emissions to concentrations where needed, and calculates the global radiative forcing and the global mean temperature change
 
### Hector v1.1
> Hartin, C. A., Bond-Lamberty, B. P., Patel, P., and Mundra, A. (2016). Ocean acidification over the next three centuries using a simple global climate carbon-cycle model: projections and sensitivities, Biogeosciences, 13, 4329 – 4342. https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-4329-2016

Hector v1.1 contains an updated ocean temperature algorithm to better match the CMIP5 mean.
 
### Hector v2.0
> Vega-Westhoff, B., Sriver, R. L., Hartin, C. A., Wong, T. E., & Keller, K. (2019). Impacts of observational constraints related to sea level on estimates of climate sensitivity. Earth's Future, 7, 677– 690. https://doi.org/10.1029/2018EF001082

Hector v2.0 incorporates a one-dimensional diffusive heat and energy balance model called [DOECLIM](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_994422_1/component/file_994421/content) and a global sea level module called [BRICK](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-10-2741-2017).

## Hector in Literature {#other_manuscripts}

### Journal articles
Below are journal articles that use or reference Hector.

[Climate module disparities explain inconsistent estimates of the social cost of carbon in integrated assessment models]()

[A permafrost implementation in the simple carbon-climate model Hector v.2.3pf](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/14/4751/2021/)

> Woodard, D. L., Shiklomanov, A. N., Kravitz, B., Hartin, C., Bond-Lamberty, B. (2021). A permafrost implementation in the simple carbon-climate model Hector v.2.3pf. Geosci. Model Dev., 14, 4751–4767. ttps://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-4751-2021

This study adds permafrost into Hector as a separate land carbon pool which decomposes into CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ when thawed. The thaw rate is controlled by region-specific air temperature increases.

[The role of climate sensitivity in upper-tail sea level rise projections](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019GL085792)

> Vega‐Westhoff, B., Sriver, R. L., Hartin, C., Wong, T. E., & Keller, K. (2020). The role of climate sensitivity in upper‐tail sea level rise projections. Geophysical Research Letters, 47, e2019GL085792. https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GL085792

This study uses Hector-BRICK to investigate the effects of Earth's equilibrium climate sensitivity, or long-term temperature response to a doubling of atmospheric CO$_2$, on sea-level rise with a focus on the high-impact upper tail.

[Calibrating simple climate models to individual Earth System Models: Lessons learned from calibrating Hector](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019EA000980)

> Dorheim, K., Link, R., Hartin, C., Kravitz, B., & Snyder, A. (2020). Calibrating simple climate models to individual Earth system models: Lessons learned from calibrating Hector. Earth and Space Science, 7, e2019EA000980. > https://doi.org/10.1029/2019EA000980 

In this article, the authors use Hector v2.5.0 to emulate the multiforcing historical and RCP scenario output for 31 concentration and seven emissions-driven Earth System Models.

[Evaluating climate emulation: fundamental impulse testing of simple climate models](https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/10/729/2019/)

> Schwarber, A. K., Smith, S. J., Hartin, C. A., Vega-Westhoff, B. A., and Sriver, R. (2019). Evaluating climate emulation: fundamental impulse testing of simple climate models, Earth Syst. Dynam., 10, 729–739. https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-729-2019

The authors use fundamental impulse tests of CO$_2$, CH$_4$, and black carbon to understand the fundamental gas cycle and climate system responses of comprehensive and idealized simple climate models. 

### RCMIP Project
The Reduced Complexity Model Intercomparison Project ([RCMIP](https://www.rcmip.org/)) is the first systematic intercomparison project for reduced-complexity climate models (RCM) and provides a standard protocol for one-line models and simple and reduced-complexity models to perform experiments from a common set of assumptions. In short, this creates a standardized test of RCMs to reproduce Earth System Model projections. Hector is one such model being used in RCMIP. 

[RCMIP Phase 1](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/13/5175/2020/) focuses on RCMs' global mean temperature responses while [RCMIP Phase 2](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020EF001900) explores the extent to which different RCMs can be calibrated to reproduce knowledge from specialized research communities.
