title: Style guide
---

The Hector package contains both R and C++ code. Hector's model components are written in C++ and use [Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html) to pass information to the R, which gives Hector users the ability to run, manipulate, and visualize Hector results in R. Contributions to Hector's R or C++ codebase must meet the respective requirements. 

## C++ Hector Code Base

### Coding style:

- New C++ code should follow the [LLVL coding standards](https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html)

The Hector codebase is periodically reformatted using [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html):

```
brew install clang-format  # (if needed)
clang-format -i src/*.cpp
clang-format -i src/ini.c
clang-format -i inst/include/*.h
clang-format -i inst/include/*.hpp
```

Other general principles:

- basic file intro at top of every file (see existing examples)
- line of dashes separating functions
- use 'const' when possible: on functions, parameters, variables
- methods should start with assertions on inputs
- try to use C++ STL or Boost data structures and functions
    (instead of rolling your own)

### Unit testing:

- writing test case is part of writing code
- every method should have at least one test if possible
- every class/subunit should have a dedicated test group

### Expected documentation:

- every method should have Doxygen comment header. Required tags:
    + `\brief`          (always)
    + `\param[in]`      (if any)
    + `\param[out]`     (if any)
    + `\returns`        (if returns a value)
    + `\exception`      (if any throws or assertions)
- all but most trivial vars should have Doxygen comments in headers
- comments should generally say WHY not WHAT


## R Hector Code Base

Some of the R code is generated by Rcpp code; do not edit these files by hand. These files all start with:   

```
# Generated by using Rcpp::compileAttributes() -> do not edit by hand
# Generator token: Numbers-Letters-Token
```

To make changes in those files, find the corresponding `.cpp` file and make changes there. 


### Coding style:

- follows the [R package](https://r-pkgs.org/) format and style guidelines 
- [R CMD checks](https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/pages/check.html) should pass CRAN checks 
- follows the [R style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)
- R code should pass `lintr::lint_package()` (this is run as one of the package tests)

### Expected documentation:

- use [roxygen](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html) documentation for all functions, required tags: 
    + `@param` to describe every function argument 
    + `@return` a description of the object returned by the function 
- clear and concise inline comments that describe WHY the code is doing what it does
- add a [vignette or article](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_vignette.html) when appropriate

### Unit testing:

- add R package [unit tests](https://testthat.r-lib.org/)
- unit tests should be quick and use minimal (if needed) package data
