title: Unit values (`unitvals`)
subtitle: C++
---

Hector both *allows* (internally to each component, and when reading inputs) and *requires* (passing data between components, and writing outputs) values to have associated **units**. The internal unit system is simple, not providing [unit conversion](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_57_0/doc/html/boost_units.html) for example, but also lightweight and easy. Our use of units is prompted primarily by safety -- to avoid the "Mars Climate Orbiter" [problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter#Cause_of_failure) of the mismatched unit -- as well as having easy-to-interpret outputs.

The internal C++ type is called `unitval`, and its code is located in `inst/include/unitval.hpp`.   
(There is also a restricted type of `unitval` called a `fluxpool` that allows only non-negative values.)

Creating a variable with associated unit
--------------

Two ways to create a `unitval`:
```
unitval x(1, U_PGC);  # x now holds 1 petagram of carbon
unitval y;
y.set(2, U_CO2_PPMV);
```

Doing math
--------------

The `unitval` class supports basic mathematical operations.
```
# assume that y and z are already defined unitvals
unitval x = y + z;  # y and z must have identical units or an error is thrown
unitval x = y * 2.0;  # multiplying by a constant always works
```

Extracting a `unitval` value
--------------
Internally within components, we often simply want to work with numbers, extracting them from `unitval` objects. This is straightforward, but first we have to 'prove' that we know the correct units:

```
double x = y.value(U_PGC); # we assert that y's units are petagrams C
```

The core will throw an error if we get the results of `y` wrong.

When is `unitval` required?
--------------
Using `unitvals` *within* a component is optional, but it's required when passing data *between* components. This falls into three categories:

* Querying the core for data. Read more about Hector's internal [data passing](InternalDataPassing.html).
* Responding to a query for data.
* Output. Read more about Hector's [output visitors](OutputVisitors.html).


Missing values
--------------
Briefly, when you need to return a missing value, use the `MISSING_FLOAT` macro defined in `inst/include/unitval.hpp`.
This macro will return `NA_REAL` (from `Rcpp`) if Hector is compiled as an R package (technically, if the `USE_RCPP` macro is defined) and `NAN` (from `std`) otherwise.

Why this complexity?  
R (and, by extension, Rcpp) distinguishes between two kinds of "placeholder" numeric values:
A _missing_ value (`NA_real_` in R; often abbreviated to `NA`) represents an unobserved value; for instance, if you take annual observations from 1990 to 2000 but failed to make a measurement in 1996.
On the other hand, _not a number_ (`NaN`) represents the result of an invalid mathematical operation, such as taking the square root of a negative number.

Both of these values propagate through any calculations in which they are involved, both in R and C++, and can be detected and removed by R's `is.na()` and similar functions.
(Note that the R function `is.nan()` can be used to check specifically for `NaN` values -- `is.nan(NaN) => TRUE`, but `is.nan(NA) => FALSE`).
However, because they mean fundamentally different things (and suggest different errors), we try to preserve this distinction if we can.
