title: "Installing and building Hector"
---

There are many ways to use Hector: as a stand-alone executable, through the 
online [HectorUI](https://jgcri.shinyapps.io/HectorUI/), and as an R package. 
Here we provide installation and 
building instructions for the R Hector package and the executable. 

# R Hector 

To install R, follow the [official instructions](https://cloud.r-project.org/) for your platform.

To install the version associated with the current `master` git branch on GitHub, 
use the `remotes`::install_github` function.
This will automatically install all of Hector's dependencies as well.
(Note that because this requires compiling from source, you will need to have a C compiler installed and configured.)

On **Windows**, you will also need to install Rtools. Download and instructions
can be found [here](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). After 
installation, there is another step to put the Rtools `make utilities` on the 
system PATH. This will allow you to compile R packages.

To do so, create a text file `.Renviron` in your Documents folder with the following line:   `PATH="${RTOOLS40_HOME}\usr\bin;${PATH}"`. 

This can be done either with a text editor or in R itself:
```r
writeLines('PATH="${RTOOLS40_HOME}\\usr\\bin;${PATH}"', con = "~/.Renviron")
```

Remember to restart R (or Rstudio) and to verify that `make` can be found. 
Executing `Sys.which("make")` should show the path to your Rtools installation. 

On **Mac OS** and **Linux**, the required tools should be included as part of a standard R installation.

```r
# If the `remotes` package isn't installed, first run:
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jgcri/hector")
```

Hector's mandatory dependencies are listed in the `DESCRIPTION` file under `Imports`, and are currently as follows:

- [`Rcpp`](http://www.rcpp.org/) -- Facilitates integration of C++ code into R packages
- [`BH`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BH/index.html) -- Boost C++ header files


# Standalone Executable

Hector can also be compiled as a standalone executable.
Unlike the R package, this method of installation does not automatically pull 
in dependencies, so you will have to install them manually.

Hector's only external dependency, **Boost**, is a free, peer-reviewed portable
C++ source library, available at http://www.boost.org/.
Hector primarily uses Boost "header-only" libraries, which do not need to be 
compiled independently and only need to be extracted and included with the Hector source.
Note that if your C++ compiler or standard library does 
[not support the C++ 17 standard](#no-stdfilesystem-support) then the Boost
`system` and `filesystem` libraries will need to be compiled/installed (see below).

## Command Line (Linux & Mac OSX)

The Hector makefiles look for Boost libraries and headers in certain
locations; these defaults can be overridden by setting the
following environment variables:

* `BOOSTROOT` (default `/usr/local/`).
This variable should contain the full name of a directory with `include/` and
`lib/` subdirectories that contain, respectively, the Boost header and library 
files. If you installed Boost using a package manager, this is likely where
it is. If you built Boost from source or used a tool such as 
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install Boost, 
then you will need to set this variable explicitly. 

Alternatively, if the header and library locations are not subdirectories of
a single directory, you can set `BOOSTINC` and `BOOSTLIB` variables to their 
respective locations. In this case, `BOOSTROOT` is ignored.

* `GTROOT` (default `/usr/local/`).
This variable should contain the full name of a directory with `include/` and
`lib/` subdirectories that contain, respectively, the Googletest header and library 
files. Alternatively, if the header and library locations are not subdirectories of
a single directory, you can set `GTINC` and `GTLIB` variables to their 
locations. In this case, `GTROOT` is ignored. **Note that this is only needed
if you want to run the Hector unit tests.** It's not needed for running the model.

**Shared Library Search Path**

If your C++ compiler or standard library does not support the C++ 17 standard
(see below), then the Boost libraries used by Hector will be
compiled into shared libraries that must be loaded at run time. It is
best if these libraries are in directories that are part of your
system's shared library search path. On many systems `/usr/local` is
already in that path.

If you are unable to add your library installation directory to the library
search path, you will need to add the installation directory to the environment 
variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.  Try not to use this approach if you can help it, 
because it can cause some conflicts with other software on your system.
Instead, ask your system administrator if `ldconfig` is right for you.

### Build & Run Hector 

Once the necessary libraries are installed, change to the top-level
Hector directory and type `make hector`. The Hector executable will
be built in the `source/` subdirectory. If you ever need to rebuild,
you can type `make clean` to clear away the executable and all of the
intermediate files.

There are two additional environment variables that you can use to
fine-tune the build process. The `CXXEXTRA` variable is passed to the
C++ compiler. You can use this variable to pass extra options to the
compiler without changing the Makefile. In particular, specifying
optimization options in `CXXEXTRA` such as -O or -O0 will override the
default value of -O3.

The `CXXPROF` variable is passed both to the compiler and the linker.
It is intended to turn on performance profiling, which must be
specified at both the compile and link stages of the build, so it
generally should be either unset (for normal operation) or set to -pg
(for profiling). Profiling slows the code down dramatically, so if you use it, be
sure to unset `CXXPROF`, clean the build directories with `make clean`, 
and rebuild when you are ready to go back to
production runs.

#### No std::filesystem Support
If your C++ compiler or standard library is too old, it will not support
the C++ 17 `std::filesystem`. In this case you may receive errors while
building Hector such as the following:

```
g++  -L.  -o hector main.o -lhector -lm 
./libhector.a(ini_to_core_reader.o): In function `boost::filesystem::exists(boost::filesystem::path const&)':
/pic/projects/GCAM/GCAM-libraries/include/boost/filesystem/operations.hpp:404: undefined reference to `boost::filesystem::detail::status(boost::filesystem::path const&, boost::system::error_code*)'
```

Or on versions of macOS prior to Catalina (10.15):
```
ini_to_core_reader.cpp:159:17: error: 'path' is unavailable: introduced in macOS
      10.15
            fs::path csvFilePath( csvFileName );
                ^
```

In this case, you can set an environment variable:
```
export NO_CXX17=1
```

and will need to [Compile Boost Libraries](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_77_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html) -- specifically, the `system` and `filesystem` libraries.  Finally, ensure 
that the environment variable `BOOSTROOT` or `BOOSTLIB` is set properly (see above).

#### Running Hector

Run Hector from the terminal:

```
./src/hector ./inst/input/name-of-ini.ini
```

To build and run the Hector unit tests, type `make testing`
and then

```
./src/unit-testing/hector-unit-tests
```

## Xcode (Mac OS X)

These directions assume a basic familiarity with Xcode and Mac OS X software installation.

* Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) if necessary. Hector has been built and tested with MacOS >= 10.8.5, up to Monterey (12.6.1). The project files are for Xcode 14.1.
* Download and install Boost, following the instructions above.
* Download the [Hector zip file](https://github.com/JGCRI/hector/archive/master.zip) or check out the repository using Git.
* From Xcode, open the project file in `project_files/Xcode/hector.xcodeproj`.

The Xcode project file is configured to use constants defining custom paths, rather than hard-coded paths.
This means that developers and users can set these paths without overwriting each other.

* As a result, **you will need to set several custom paths** (Preferences -> Locations -> Custom Paths): `BOOSTROOT`, and `HECTORDIR`.
    * `BOOSTROOT` is the root directory where the Boost headers can be found in `boost/`.  
    * `HECTORDIR` should be set to root directory for the model (the repository root) Xcode will use this path to the ini files used by the various schemes and write the csv files to the output directory. 

* If you want to build Hector's testing framework (the `hector-tests` target; this is optional and only relevant for C++ developers) add GTEST and GTESTLIB custom paths to Xcode; these are analogous to their Boost counterparts. You will need to install [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest) on your machine.

At this point you should be ready to go:

* Build the project, making sure you're building the `hector` target.
* Run!
* To run a different scenario, change the current Scheme settings (Scheme->Edit Scheme) and modify or add a command-line argument (*Arguments* tab, e.g. "./inst/input/hector_ssp245.ini"). 

The Xcode profile file includes a `hector-tests` target that builds the unit
testing framework described above.

## Visual Studio / Microsoft Visual C++

* Install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) and be sure to the Visual C++ add-on as well.
* Download and install [Boost](https://www.boost.org).
* Set the environment variables:
  * `BOOSTROOT` to the location to which you installed Boost (e.g. `C:\boost_1_75_0`)
* Open the Visual Studio project file which is located in your Hector repository under `project_files/VS/hector.sln`
* Build the `hector` target
* To run Hector:
  * From the CMD prompt: `project_files/VS/x64/Release/hector.exe ./inst/input/name-of-ini.ini`
  * From with in the Visual Studio debugger (the working directory will default to `project_files/VS`): `x64/Release/hector.exe ../../inst/input/name-of-ini.ini`
