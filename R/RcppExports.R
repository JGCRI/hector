#' Create and initialize a new hector core
#'
#' The object returned is a handle to the newly created core.  It will be required as an
#' argument for all functions that operate on the core.  Creating multiple cores
#' simultaneously is supported.
#'
#' @param infile (String) name of the hector input file.
#' @return handle for the Hector core.
#' @export
newcore <- function(inifile) {
    .Call('_hector_newcore', PACKAGE = 'hector', inifile)
}

#' Shutdown a hector core
#'
#' Shutting down a core will free the core itself and all of the objects it created. Any attempted
#' operation on the core after that will raise an error.
#'
#' @param core Handle to the core that is to be shut down.
#' @return The core handle, modified to show that it is no longer active.
#' @export

#' Run the Hector climate model
#'
#' Run Hector up through the specified time.  This function does not return the results
#' of the run.  To get results, run \code{fetch}.
#'
#' @param core Handle to the hector core that is to be run.
#' @param runtodate Date to run to.  The default is to run to the end date configured
#' in the input file used to initialize the core.
#' @export
