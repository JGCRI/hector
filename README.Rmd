This is the repository for **Hector**, an open source, object-oriented, simple 
global climate carbon-cycle model that runs very quickly while still
representing the most critical global scale earth system processes. 
Hector is a simple climate model (SCM, also known as a reduced-complexity climate model),
a class of models that are extremely versatile with a wide
range of applications. Due to their computational efficiency, SCMs can easily
be coupled to other models and used to design scenarios, emulate more complex 
climate models, and conduct uncertainty analyses.

## Installation 

The `hector` R package can be installed using the `remotes::install_github` 
function. More detailed installation instructions, including how to set up
Hector as a command line executable, can be found [here](articles/BuildHector.html).

```r
remotes::install_github('jgcri/hector')
library(hector)
```

## Tools and Software That Work with Hector

* [GCAM](https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core): Hector can be used as the climate component in [GCAM](http://jgcri.github.io/gcam-doc/)
* [pyhector](https://github.com/openclimatedata/pyhector): a Python
interface to Hector
* [fldgen](https://github.com/JGCRI/fldgen): a spatially resolved temperature & precipitation emulator for CMIP5 ESMs
