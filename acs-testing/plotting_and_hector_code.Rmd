# Read in data from runs

CRITICAL: the offline model outputs files labeled 

`ag_emiss_<scenarioinfo>.csv` , `bg_emiss_<scenarioinfo>.csv`

based on tracing through code, these are GCAM style emissions i.e. land to
atmosphere flows. Tracethrough captured in definitions slide deck but to summarize:
GCAM style emissions are 

`carbon_content_change = cdiff = c_stock(prev)-cstock(current)` 

and if "If carbon content increases , then carbon was sequestered." (comment from
simple carbon calc). In terms of cdiff, increasing carbon content <=> 
current > prev <=> cdiff < 0.  

So that's why the code variables `ag_emissions`, `luc_total` are land to atmoshphere.

NBP is atmosphere to land. Dawn correctly flips the direction of carbon flow
in the call to Hector on each time step to get updated T and C for feedback.

But the code output is still land to to atmosphere so for plotting NBP, we have
to flip the code outputs for plotting.

  # simulates global NPP and Rh and combines the 3 processes to get NBP.

It is NOT a result that 'coupling changes unmanged land from a source to a sink.'
The pink vs blue line is not an apples to apples comparison of processes.

Note that the uncoupled does not have NPP and Rh effects, and we can only get
those globally from Hector, not for mgd vs unmgd. 

But it adjacent to how reporting definitions are hard and different definitions 
can have different results. 

# Comparison to GCP

## Read in and understand GCP data

This is true NBP: atmosphere to land, positive NBP = a sink

```{r}
# load the file passed from Dawn
gcp_data_dawn <- read.csv("GCP_data/nbp_gcp.csv")

# Load the file pulled directly from GCP:
read.csv('GCP_data/Global_Carbon_Budget_2022v1p0_historical_co2_tab.csv', stringsAsFactors = F) %>%
  select(year=Year, e_luc=land.use.change.emissions, s_land = land.sink, Units) %>%
  tidyr::replace_na(list(e_luc=0)) %>%
  # If we want to sum e_luc + s_land, uncomment from the `gather` to `ungroup` 
  # calls here and comment out the `mutate`:
  # gather(reporting_id, value, -year, -Units) %>%
  # group_by(year, Units) %>%
  # summarize(nbp = -sum(value, na.rm=T)) %>%
  # ungroup %>%
  # Following slide 56 of GCP_data/papers/GCP_CarbonBudget_2023_slides_v1.0-2-Alissa-Haward.pdf
  mutate(nbp = (s_land - e_luc)) ->
  gcp_data
```

### Check if GCP data and Dawn's agree

Check if `nbp = (s_land-e_luc)` from the raw GCP download agrees
 with file from Dawn. Note Dawn's file did `-(s_land-e_luc)` to have things
 in the land to atmosphere direction instead, and compare with offline model 
 outputs directly. so  have to do minus a minus

```{r}

print("Difference to Dawn's file:")
print(max(abs(gcp_data$nbp - -gcp_data_dawn$nbp)))
```

## Proceed with GCP data

Label data and convert units

```{r}

# Label data and convert units
gcp_data$scenario <- "1. Global Carbon Project"
gcp_data$nbp_raw <- gcp_data$nbp*1000
gcp_data$nbp <- rollmean(gcp_data$nbp*1000,k=10,fill=NA)

## Compare full NBP's to GCP (GCP 2 of 2 in old code)

Assuming that GCP total land flux is land allocation, NPP, Rh effects on all 
leaves

### Run uncoupled through hector so have effect of land change, NPP, Rh

We DON'T flip the offline model's emissions file direction for this because
this is the old way of Hector, which expects land to atmosphere and does the
flip itself.

```

- This is as apples to apples as we can get it for now. Ocean is possibly different
for coupled run. But, it seems clear that having the coupling introduces much
more of a sink. 

- This _was_ the case in Dawn's figures as best we could tell - have to infer
from their figure's uncoupled plus how our 'uncoupled' changes before and
after we plot hector's NBP. 


- Suggests that we need different beta and q10 values when having spatial dynamics.

- based on Dawn's results, lower beta

- ACS at least, this seems reasonable considering we now have Leaf level NPP and
Rh affecting densities. 

- having the same beta and q10 for every leaf is going to be wrong no matter 
what, the point is that now we have the option to do better with more research.

- And for now, it just means that having the leaf-level dynamics means we need
a different beta and q10 for every leaf than for old style runs.

- there's _probably_ some averageing we could do to figure out ok if we estimate
(roughly, because it's wrong anyway) a beta and q10 value that gets the coupled
version closer to GCP, what would the Old-style Hector beta and q10 need to be
for the uncoupled version to match the coupled. 

- guess we could do the reverse easily, run the uncoupled through Hector for a 
bunch of different beta and q10 values to see what makes resulting NBP match 
coupled.

- For paper, could imagine this plot without `scenario 4` but with two different
versions of the 'coupled': one with the same set of beta and q10 as default Hector 
(what we do now) but also with a 'better' beta and q10 value to match GCP

- other notes, considering Hector's new beta and q10 value: recent history
coming in too low compared to GCP with beta = .53, q10 = 1.76. Uncoupled coming
in too high with beta = .55 and q10=2.2. Could split the difference to get
q10=2 and just lower beta until the coupled run matches GCP better? Hoping KM has
better informed choice.

# Run Hector with each NBP.

Running the NBP from the uncoupled scenario, which comes from a hector run, through
hector again might be wrong? Plot of Tas and CO2 for that run above so can compare

- look close but hard to eyeball

- interesting hector test with default files, run core, fetch NBP, set nbp to that in a core, run again

Weird stuff: highest to lowest NBP is: Coupled, uncoupled, GCP

- Highest to lowest temperature and CO2 is GCP, coupled, uncoupled. Would have expected
GCP, uncoupled, coupled? Why is that big sink from coupled NBP not resulting in MUCH
lower temperatures????

- and why is the uncoupled NBP close GCP but the temperature is DRAMATICALLY lower

- Maybe I don't understand hector

- I have a number in DW Sept 2022 slides that 1959-2020 atmospheric CO2 avg is
~443 ppm, and avg temp anomaly ~1.6degC 

- this plot only goes to 2005 so the Hector run with GCP might be a little higher
than that but with updated ocean param, maybe not bad.



# tests for Hector

of stuff without the offline model coming in at all

## using updated ini file

 In theory we are totally ignoring the land module in Hector by setting the NBP constraint so it maybe shouldn't be an issue that the beta and q10 values in that ini file is out of sync with what our runs were done with. and we will be doing them with a synced up version. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Run with GCP NBP
coreGCP_newini <- hector::newcore(ini_file585, name = 'GCP_NBP_newini')
setvar(coreGCP_newini,gcp_data$year,"NBP_constrain",gcp_data$nbp*0.001,"Pg C/yr")
hector::run(coreGCP_newini,runtodate = 2005)
outGCP_newini  <-fetchvars(coreGCP_newini,dates=1750:2005,vars=c(GLOBAL_TAS(),CONCENTRATIONS_CO2(), NBP()))

```


## run hector with pkg ini, re-feed NBP from that

```{r, eval=FALSE}

rcp <- "ssp585"
scenario_file <- paste0("input/hector_",rcp,".ini")
ini_file585 <- system.file(scenario_file, package="hector")

core585 <- hector::newcore(ini_file585, suppresslogging = FALSE, name='585')
hector::run(core585,runtodate = 2100)


core585_nbp  <- hector::fetchvars(core585, dates=1746:2020, vars=c(NBP()))

core585_new <- hector::newcore(ini_file585, name = 'pkg_585_nbp')
setvar(core585_new, core585_nbp$year,"NBP_constrain", core585_nbp$value,"Pg C/yr")

hector::run(core585_new,runtodate = 2020)

out585_new  <-fetchvars(core585_new,dates=1750:2020,vars=c(GLOBAL_TAS(),CONCENTRATIONS_CO2(), NBP()))



ggplot(out %>% filter(year <=2015)) + geom_line(aes(x = year, y = value, color = scenario)) +
  geom_line(data = gcp_data , mapping = aes(x = year, y = nbp/1000))+
  ggtitle('Hector nbp vs GCP, in Hector units \nNote this is updated hector params in acs install \nbeta=.53, q10=1.76, ocean = ???')

```

## frankenstein GCP

 From like 1975 on, update the nbp values to be double or triple and see what Hector does with that?
