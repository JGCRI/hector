Hector 2.2.2
============
* Fix bug that was causing requests for H2O forcing in the R interface
  to return N2O forcing instead (the model internals were
  unaffected). 
* Fix bug that was causing API requests for halocarbon forcing to
  return absolute forcing values, rather than values relative to the
  base year (which is what is done for all other forcings). 
* Add missing RF_VOL (volcanic forcing) dependency to forcing component.  In practice the
  missing dependency had no effect because the forcing component
  already had a dependency on the SO2 component, which also provides
  the volcanic forcing, but in the event that we ever split them up,
  this will ensure that the dependency graph is still valid.
  
(All 2.2.2 changes merged in PR #303)

Hector 2.2.1
============
* Report global averages for land temperature, ocean air
  temperature, and ocean surface temperature.
* Fix bug that prevented CH4 emissions from being read.

Hector 2.2.0
============
* Add a new parameter: VOLCANIC_SCALE.  This parameter adjusts the
  strength of the response to volcanic forcing.  (PR #291)
* Add getname function to return the name of a Hector core.


Hector 2.1.0
============
* Add reset() function to the API.  Calling this function resets a
  hector core to an earlier time, rerunning the spinup if
  appropriate.  (PR #243)


Hector 2.0.0
============
* Incorporated 1-D diffusive ocean heat model as new temperature component (DOECLIM) (PR #206)
* Bugfix: double counting halocarbon radiative forcing (PR #201)
* Bugfix: re-enabled CO2 concentration constraint (PR #163)  
* Various changes to internals to support calling Hector from external code like pyhector
* Component loggers are now optional (PR #218)
* Renamed anthro emissions to ffi emisisons (fossil fuel industrial) (PR #116)


Hector 1.1.2
============

* Add libhector target OS X and Windows project files (it was already
  available in the Linux build).  This library library is used when
  you want to link Hector to an outside program.

Hector 1.1.1
============

* Fix OS X build
* Update sample output files
* Add GPL license

Hector 1.1
===========

* API for linking with external models.

* Backend R scripts faster and cleaner.

* Minor bug fixes and documentation updates.


Hector 1.0
===========

* First release. Corresponds to Hartin et al. (2015), http://www.geosci-model-dev.net/8/939/2015/gmd-8-939-2015.pdf.
